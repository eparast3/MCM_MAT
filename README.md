# MCM_MAT
Matlab subroutines to initialize the MCM fortran codes

The codes are tested on Matlab in Linux environment. For windows environment, it may has problems.
'main.m' is the main script which will call some other subroutines in the 'libs' folder. So you should add the 'libs' folder into you Matlab path first before runing the program.
