# Right-hand coordinate systerm in Cartesian coordinate. X: North; Y: East; Z: vertical down.
# The veolocity model can be homogeneous or layered. If there is only one layer, it is a homogeneous model.

0                           | float. Depth of the free surface of the model in meter, can be negtive or positive. 0 means the depth of free surface is at the sea-level. Equals to -elevation.
100    3500      2000       | float-float-float. Thickness(m)-Vp(m/s)-Vs(m/s) of the layer 1.
...                         | float-float-float. Thickness(m)-Vp(m/s)-Vs(m/s) of the layer 2.
